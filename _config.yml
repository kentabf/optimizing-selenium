title: Optimizing the threadcount of a multithreaded Selenium web scraper
description: I built a web scraper with Python's Selenium library to make a little over 19,000 queries on a webpage search engine (part of economics research work for a professor). With a high I/O time-cost for each query/scrape (anywehere from 4 to 10 seconds), I implemented it as a multithreaded scraper, running multiple webdrivers simultaneously. This side project answers the very simple question - what's the optimum threadcount?
